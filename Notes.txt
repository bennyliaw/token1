// Notes

smart contract:
  - code is permanent after deployed. so token contract after released cannot be altered in any way
  - using scheme (e.g. factory, proxy...) to future proof ..
  - shall differentiate token (pre)sales contract (with sell, softcap, pausable, time contraint etc) vs token contract (the ERC20) itself
  - known attack:
          short addr attack etc (require payload size),
           uint boundary (use safemath), etc
  -


solidity:
  - pure/view vs constant:
     * constant deprecated by ^.17 for function as confusing
     * pure not even accessing state var, eg. safemath lib only act on params
 - internal vs private:
     * internal is like protected in C++, allowing sub class to use
