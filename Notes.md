# Some Notes
  Benny Yao :

# smart contract:
  - code is permanent after deployed. so token contract after released cannot be altered in any way
  - using scheme (e.g. factory, proxy...) --> future proof ..
  - shall differentiate token (pre)sales contract (with sell, softcap, pausable, time contraint etc) vs token contract (the ERC20) itself
  - known attack:
          short addr attack etc (require payload size),
          uint boundary (use safemath), etc
  -


# solidity:
  - pure/view vs constant:
     * constant deprecated by ^.17 for function as confusing
     * pure not even accessing state var, eg. safemath lib only act on params
 - internal vs private:
     * internal is like protected in C++, allowing sub class to use
 - state (auto persisted, and would cost esp for writes) vs memory (local var)
 - reading state var is cheap, as can be done in/by local nodes

# reviewing DemoCoin ICO: https://erc20token.sonnguyen.ws/en/latest/
- need pragma, constant keywords to be replaced with view
- in transferFrom function the below memory assignment is redundant, could be inline same as updating balances state
    >> var _allowance = allowed[_from][msg.sender];
- Unused state in IcoToken:
    >> address public icoSaleDeposit;
- Should have use require than assert to validate input; so remaining gas gets refunded
    in IcoToken.sell first line:
    >> assert(_value > 0);
- why the below in IcoToken.sell
    >> Transfer(0x0, owner, _value);

- in IcoContract.CreateICO, why LogCreateICO is called before ico.sell, and what if sell returns false?
- how do you give reserved Tokens to founder, etc.
- how does the fallback in IcoContract works ?
    >> function () payable
   --> answered in http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html
- IcoContract.createTokens can be refactored such that no duplication on common parts just need to update tokensToAllocate, and add etherToRefund step for the softcap reached
